## reNamenator

reNamenator is a tool for replacing characters in the names of files or folders that are dropped onto the program. 

Many files that are downloaded from the net have names where spaces are substituted with dots, dashes or underscores. This tool replaces all instances of these in any file or folder dropped on the program. 

Typically named problem files include:

*This.is.a.file.you.downloaded.rar*

*This_is_a_folder_you_extracted_from_that_file*

Replace these characters with spaces, empty space or whatever character you like.

### Installation

### Usage

2. Watch the magic.

### Notes

It will not recurse through child folders or files if a folder is dropped onto the program.

Future updates if anyone shows interest may include, logging, options and feature requests.

Please do file issues if you come across anything odd.
